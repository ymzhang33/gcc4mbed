# USAGE:
# Variables that must be defined in including makefile.
#   PROJECT: Name to be given to the output binary for this project.
#   GCC4MBED_DIR: The root directory for where the gcc4mbed sources are located
#                 in your project.  This should point to the parent directory
#                 of the build directory which contains this gcc4mbed.mk file.
#
# Variables that may be optionally set in makefile.
#   SRC: The root directory for the sources of your project.  Defaults to '.'.
#   LIBS_PREFIX: List of library/object files to prepend to mbed.ar capi.ar libs.
#   LIBS_SUFFIX: List of library/object files to append to mbed.ar capi.ar libs.
#   GCC4MBED_TYPE: Type of build to produce.  Allowed values are:
#                  Debug - Build for debugging.  Disables optimizations and
#                          links in debug MRI runtime.  Best debugging 
#                          experience.
#                  Release - Build for release with no debug support.
#                  Checked - Release build with debug support.  Due to
#                            optimizations, debug experience won't be as good
#                            as Debug but might be needed when bugs don't
#                            reproduce in Debug builds.
#                  default: Release
#   GPFLAGS: Additional compiler flags used when building C++ sources.
#   GCFLAGS: Additional compiler flags used when building C sources.
#   AS_GCFLAGS: Additional compiler flags used by GCC when building
#               preprocessed assembly language sources.
#   AS_FLAGS: Additional assembler flags used when building assembly language
#             sources.
#   NO_FLOAT_SCANF: When set to 1, scanf() will not support %f specifier to
#                   input floating point values.  Reduces code size.
#   NO_FLOAT_PRINTF: When set to 1, scanf() will not support %f specifier to
#                    output floating point values.  Reduces code size.
#   VERBOSE: When set to 1, all build commands will be displayed to console.
#            It defaults to 0 which suppresses the output of the build tool
#            command lines themselves.
#   MRI_BREAK_ON_INIT: Should the program halt before calling into main(),
#                      allowing the developer time to set breakpoints in main()
#                      or in code run from within global constructors.
#                      default: 1 - break on init.
#   MRI_SEMIHOST_STDIO: Set to non-zero value to allow debug monitor to use
#                       semi-host calls to redirect stdin/stdout/stderr to the
#                       gdb console.
#                       default: 1 for Debug/Checked builds and 0 for Release.
#   MRI_UART: Select the UART to be used by the debugger.  See mri.h for
#             allowed values.
#             default: MRI_UART_MBED_USB - Use USB based UART on the mbed.
# Example makefile:
#       PROJECT=HelloWorld
#       SRC=.
#       GCC4MBED_DIR=../..
#       LIBS_PREFIX=../agutil/agutil.ar
#       LIBS_SUFFIX=
